# Student-Performance-Prediction

This project aims to predict student performance based on various demographic, socio-economic, and academic factors.

## Project Report: Forecasting Academic Achievement

### 1. Overview
In this study, we used machine learning approaches to predict student performance based on multiple characteristics. The dataset used in this analysis includes data on the academic performance, family history, and demographics of the students.

### 2. Investigation of Data
- Investigated the dataset to learn about its composition and organization.
- Encoded categorical variables and dealt with missing values.
- Investigated connections between attributes and the goal variable and produced a visual representation of the distribution of final grades.

### 3. Engineering features
- Added new features or changed current ones in light of the findings from exploratory data analysis.
- To get the data ready for modeling, one-hot encoded categorical variables were used.

### 4. Development of Models
- For modeling student performance, the RandomForestRegressor algorithm was chosen.
- Divide the data into sets for testing and training.
- Trained the model and used mean squared error to assess its effectiveness.

### 5. Model Implementation
- The trained model has been stored for later use in a file called `student_performance_model.pkl`.
- Described how to load the model and make predictions in different contexts as part of the model deployment process.
- Spoke about possible ways to implement the model, including running it as a web application on Heroku or Google Cloud Platform.

### 6. Concluding remarks
- Based on the available features, the RandomForestRegressor model performed reasonably well in forecasting student performance.
- The implementation of models enables predictions to be made on fresh data, opening up possible uses for early intervention and support in educational institutions.
- To increase the accuracy and usefulness of the model, more advancements can involve experimenting with various machine learning algorithms, feature engineering methods, and deployment approaches.

### 7. Upcoming Projects
- Examine additional elements like extracurricular activities and social contacts that might have an impact on students' performance.
- Use more sophisticated modeling strategies to capture intricate correlations in the data, such as ensemble approaches or neural networks.
- To find out how well intervention tactics in educational contexts work with the predictive model, run A/B tests.
