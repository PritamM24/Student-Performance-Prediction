# Student-Performance-Prediction
This project aims to predict student performance based on various demographic, socio-economic, and academic factors.

<h1>Project Report: Forecasting Academic Achievement</h1>
<b>1. Overview</b><br>
In this study, we used machine learning approaches to predict student performance based on multiple characteristics. The dataset used in this analysis includes data on the academic performance, family history, and demographics of the students.

<b>2. Investigation of Data</b>
<li>
<ul>Investigated the dataset to learn about its composition and organization.</ul>
<ul>Encoded categorical variables and dealt with missing values.</ul>
<ul>Investigated connections between attributes and the goal variable and produced a visual representation of the distribution of final grades.</ul></li>

<b>3. Engineering features</b>
<li>
<ul>Added new features or changed current ones in light of the findings from exploratory data analysis.</ul>
<ul>To get the data ready for modeling, one-hot encoded categorical variables were used.</ul></li>
<b>4. Development of Models</b>
<li>
<ul>For modeling student performance, the RandomForestRegressor algorithm was chosen.</ul>
<ul>Divide the data into sets for testing and training.</ul>
<ul>Trained the model and used mean squared error to assess its effectiveness.</ul></li>
